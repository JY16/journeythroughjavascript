        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Jamie. I am a Front End Developer. Though I know the basics of JavaScript I am still learning the
            more intermediate/advanced aspects of JavaScript. Along with JavaScript, I am learning Sass, Git/GitHub, and
            jQuery. After I have a solid understanding of these, I will go on to learn node and react and all that they
            require. To further my skills, I will learn some other languages/technologies for both my professional and
            personal development.
        </p>
        <p>
            How did I get into web development? Well, it was not intentional. It started back in 2012. I was looking for
            electives for Fall semester. I came across an Intro to Internet/Web class. I had never give any thought to
            how websites were made. I was interested so I enrolled. In the Summer of 2013, I found myself going through
            the textbook again and learning more HTML and CSS. In 2014, I decided to change my major from Business
            Administration to Web Technologies and took a few more classes. When it came time for me to learn JavaScript,
            I felt that I was not ready. (I was wary of JavaScript. I did not want to believe or accept that I had to
            learn JavaScript.) Since 2015, I have been teaching myself web development with various online resources.
            When I was "ready" to learn JavaScript it did not go well. It was hard for me to find really good learning
            resources for JavaScript and I had gotten a little discouraged. It was not until recently that I found
            quality learning resources and began to really understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am looking forward to learning all that I develop a desire and/or need to learn and to the apps, software,
            and websites, maybe even a game, that I will make.
